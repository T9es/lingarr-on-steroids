## Release v2.0.0 - PostgreSQL Migration & Reliability Improvements

### ⚠️ Breaking Change

**MySQL/MariaDB support has been removed.** PostgreSQL is now the default database.

### Migration Notes

> **Upgrading from v1.x?**
> - Data is NOT automatically migrated from MySQL
> - Settings need reconfiguration (~5 min)
> - Media re-syncs from Radarr/Sonarr automatically
> - Review updated docker-compose examples in README

### 🗄️ Database

- PostgreSQL 16 is now the recommended and default database backend
- SQLite remains available for simple setups
- MVCC eliminates lock contention issues during parallel processing
- MySQL/MariaDB support has been completely removed

### ✨ New Features

- **Deferred Contextual Repair**: Smarter batch recovery - collects failed translations during processing, then retries them together at the end with surrounding context lines. The LLM sees what came before/after, dramatically improving recovery success.
- **Bulk Integrity Check**: New settings page for batch subtitle validation
- **Sparse Subtitle Validation**: Extraction markers and NoSuitableSubtitles state
- **Throttled Progress Signals**: Efficient batch operation updates via SignalR
- **Self-Healing Hangfire Locks**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned locks on startup

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Robust batch retry for translation requests (prevents 500 errors)
- Settings KeyNotFoundException resolved with harmonized database keys
- PostgreSQL performance optimizations and language retrieval fixes
- Connection resiliency with execution strategy support
- Increased Hangfire DistributedLockTimeout to 24 hours
- Incremental visibility during sync jobs

### 🚧 Reverted (Planned for Future)

- Subtitle provider integration (pending further work)
